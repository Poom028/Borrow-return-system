# Delete Functionality Fix - Equipment Quantity Management

## Problem Description
Previously, when clicking the 'Delete' button:
- ✅ The item was removed from the list correctly
- ❌ The available quantity was NOT updated in the backend
- ❌ Refreshing the page would reset quantities to previous values
- ❌ Stock counts were not persisted

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Updated `routes/notes.py`
- **Modified `delete_note` function**: Now parses equipment information from the note title and restores quantities to the database
- **Modified `create_note` function**: Now parses equipment information and reduces quantities when creating a note
- **Added `parse_equipment_from_title` function**: Extracts equipment names and quantities from note titles

#### Updated `routes/equipment.py`
- **Added `/equipment/public` endpoint**: Provides equipment data without authentication for frontend display

#### Created `init_equipment.py`
- **Database initialization script**: Sets up default equipment items with proper quantities
- **Run once**: `python init_equipment.py` to populate the database

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Updated `pages/dashboard.vue`
- **Replaced hardcoded devices**: Now fetches equipment data from backend API
- **Added `fetchEquipment()` function**: Retrieves current equipment quantities from backend
- **Updated delete function**: Now refreshes equipment data after deletion
- **Added image mapping**: Maps equipment names to their respective images
- **Improved error handling**: Fallback to default devices if API fails

### 3. Data Flow

#### When Creating a Note (Borrowing Equipment):
1. User selects equipment and enters borrower name
2. Frontend sends note data to backend
3. Backend parses equipment information from title
4. Backend reduces equipment quantities in database
5. Note is saved with equipment details

#### When Deleting a Note (Returning Equipment):
1. User clicks delete button
2. Backend retrieves note before deletion
3. Backend parses equipment information from note title
4. Backend restores equipment quantities to database
5. Note is deleted
6. Frontend refreshes equipment data to show updated quantities

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Flow
1. **Borrow Equipment**: Select equipment and create a note
2. **Verify Quantities**: Check that available quantities decrease
3. **Delete Note**: Click delete on the created note
4. **Verify Restoration**: Check that quantities are restored to original values
5. **Refresh Page**: Verify that changes persist after page refresh

## Database Schema

### Equipment Collection
```javascript
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "name": "ลูกฟุตบอล",
  "quantity": 5
}
```

### Notes Collection
```javascript
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "title": "ยืม : ลูกฟุตบอล 2 ชิ้น, ลูกบาส 1 ชิ้น\nชื่อ : John Doe",
  "content": "John Doe",
  "created_at": ISODate,
  "user": ObjectId
}
```

## Key Benefits

✅ **Persistent Changes**: Equipment quantities are now stored in the database
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Frontend automatically refreshes data after operations
✅ **Data Consistency**: Backend and frontend are now synchronized
✅ **Proper Stock Management**: Borrowing and returning properly affects available quantities
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if backend is unavailable

## Files Modified

- `backend/routes/notes.py` - Enhanced delete and create functions
- `backend/routes/equipment.py` - Added public equipment endpoint
- `backend/init_equipment.py` - Database initialization script
- `frontend/pages/dashboard.vue` - Updated to use backend API

## Future Improvements

- Add equipment return functionality (separate from note deletion)
- Implement equipment reservation system
- Add equipment maintenance tracking
- Create equipment usage analytics
- Add bulk equipment operations
